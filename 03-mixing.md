## The output

The `swupd` software delivery mechanism treats everything as an update. 
It does this by querying metadata from an update server and calculating 
what it needs to do and which content to use. The format of this data 
and metadata is very simple, and easy to understand and reproduce, but 
`swupd` needs a lot of it.

As the update content describes every file in the OS, it is a large 
database that needs to be kept synchronized on the client system. 
Maintaining these metadata lists is expensive, and the system is 
designed to do all the hard work on the server side, so that clients 
only need to work on small subsets of the data to perform the needed 
operations to update or install components.

`swupd` uses separate files for content and for metadata. Content often 
does not change between versions. To save space the server only stores 
one copy of each file in the version that it was last updated. This 
content is also compressed on the server, and each piece of content is 
identified by a hash value that is unique for both the content of the 
data, and the properties of the inode on the file system. In this way, 
if a file changes permissions, xattr tags or ownership, this is 
considered a normal update from one content unit to a new content unit.

The metadata is similarly reused between different versions of the OS. 
This means that if a bundle doesn't change between two versions, the 
`swupd` client will reuse the older version. If a bundle *does* change, 
metadata will be updated according to the precise content changes 
introduced in the new version. This allows clients to reconstruct a 
full new view of the work that needs to be done while maximizing reuse 
of the already known metadata.

### Metadata

The metadata that `swupd` uses is stored in Manifests. These manifest 
files come in two different levels. Each bundle is maintained in its 
own Manifest file, and there is one Manifest-of-Manifests file that 
contains metadata on all the Manifests that exist for each bundle.

Here is how a Manifest file looks:

```
MANIFEST	25
version:	21810
previous:	21800
filecount:	1975
timestamp:	1523538780
contentsize:	46217487

D...	6c27df6efcd6fc401ff1bc67c970b83eef115f6473db4fb9d57e5de317eba96e	21530	/boot

L...	3f2e21f5de1fb40955f59667b837b6004254581e64404ce0f0f692bc35a22d76	21530	/usr/bin/base32
F...	634ed1be7098435e3a3f28f13740b260e171e9d65891a002998d1e5fc691b471	21530	/usr/bin/chattr
<snip>
```

At the top of the manifest is some generic metadata that various cli 
commands use to make e.g. searching produce better output. The `format 
version` sits right at the top and describes the epoch, or generation 
of the metadata format. While the format itself is largely stable, it 
will be changed any time a breaking change is introduced to the 
metadata format. Because this change requires a corresponding client 
update a format boundary will assure clients update to a certain 
version to get the new updater. In this way it can be used as a 
milepost marker. The `version` and `previous` items describe the actual 
Clear Linux OS version that this metadata is from.

After the header, there follows a long list of content metadata that 
describes the files, directories and links, their content/metadata 
hashes, the version last changed, and the various informational flags 
for client use.

From left to right, the columns designate the type of content, the hash 
of the content, the content version that introduced the content, and 
ends with the name of the content as it appears on disk.

The hash itself directly points to a content item on the update server, 
and can be found on the HTTP service directly. For instance, from the 
above list we can find the `chattr` file by the following URL:

```
https://download.clearlinux.org/update/21530/files/634ed1be7098435e3a3f28f13740b260e171e9d65891a002998d1e5fc691b471.tar
```

Note the version number in the URL isn't `21810` but this content comes 
from an earlier update, as listed in the Manifest(`21530`).


### Content 

The content that `swupd` delivers is provided to the OS in different 
ways to optimize the download and make it as small as possible. For the 
most common cases the server calculates the mininum needed delta 
between the content files and creates a binary diff that is very 
efficient. In the case the client needs a clean, and full, copy of the 
original file, this is also provided. And in the case of someone 
installing an entire bundle, the bundle content is provided as a 
tarball of the entire content all at once.

The content comes in compressed tar files:

```
$ curl -s -L -O https://download.clearlinux.org/update/21530/files/634ed1be7098435e3a3f28f13740b260e171e9d65891a002998d1e5fc691b471.tar
$ file 634ed1be7098435e3a3f28f13740b260e171e9d65891a002998d1e5fc691b471.tar 
634ed1be7098435e3a3f28f13740b260e171e9d65891a002998d1e5fc691b471.tar: XZ compressed data
```
The compression is usually XZ, as this is the most efficient 
compression method for most of the content. However, in some cases, the 
files will be bzip2 or gzip compressed. The server automatically finds 
the best compression algorithm for the content.

The server also creates delta packs, and zero packs. These are 
optimizations where the server speculatively combines content based on 
the assumption that you will need many of them for certain actions. The 
client will use them if they are available, but they are entirely 
optional. Delta packs contain the binary deltas for changes to files 
made from the source update to the target update. For any new files or 
files with changes too large to make a binary delta worth it a full 
file is included in the delta pack itself. In this way delta packs 
contain an update from one arbitrary version to another.

These delta files are created as much as possible to provide clients 
with the smallest download possible between two versions. These are 
binary deltas made using the `bsdiff` software. They can provide a 
significant reduction to the needed download size, but they only work 
if the client has the original file already, so they are not always 
used. In order for the client to use the delta files, the original 
content must also be verified prior to patching.

Similarly, zero packs define an update from one version to another, but 
the source version is always zero. Since the zero release contained no 
files the zero pack contains all full files present in the target 
version.


## Mixing

The `mixer-tools` suite software is what generates the update server 
content. It does this using the following inputs:

* The Clear Linux OS official software update content
* Local Bundle definitions
* Local RPM files

This is exactly how the Clear Linux OS team generates the official 
software update content, except that the official Clear Linux OS has no 
`upstream` that it bases itself on, and always uses its own bundle 
definitions and RPM files to create all the content. The tooling is 
exactly the same, however.

At the start, we've already seen how the update content looks after it 
comes out of the mixer. The goal of this chapter is to get you familiar 
with the methods used to create this yourself.


## Initializing the workspace

The mixer tools use a simple workspace to contain all input and output 
in a simple folder hierarchy. We'll call this the mixer workspace. You 
can create it simply by making an empty folder:

```
~ $ mkdir ~/mix
~ $ cd ~/mix
~/mix $
```

From here on, we'll be using the `mixer` cli tool extensively. This is 
a good point in time to review the cli and read through the options and 
general usage before going to use the various options that it has, as 
you will run into them later at some point.

```
~/mix $ mixer --help
Mixer is a tool used to compose OS update content and images.

Usage:
  mixer [flags]
  mixer [command]

Available Commands:
  add-rpms    Add RPMs to local dnf repository
  build       Build various pieces of OS content
  bundle      Perform various actions on bundles
  config      Perform config related actions
  help        Help about any command
  init        Initialize the mixer and workspace
  versions    Manage mix and upstream versions

Flags:
      --check        Check all dependencies needed by mixer and quit
  -h, --help         help for mixer
      --offline      Skip caching upstream-bundles; work entirely with local-bundles
      --version      Print version information and quit

Use "mixer [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

This is also the last chance to double check that `mixer` is 
functionally complete and you don't need to install any more Clear 
Linux OS bundles.

```
~/mix $ mixer --check
```

We start by initializing mixer. Since we'll be doing more detailed 
exercises later in subsequent chapters, we'll be adding a few options 
to prevent later having to reinitialize the workspace.

We are also going to be making updates to the content, both from 
upstream and from our own changes. To demonstrate this, we'll start the 
mix with a slightly older version of Clear Linux OS in order to 
demonstrate how this works.

```
~/mix $ mixer init --clear-version 21530 --mix-version 10 --local-rpms 
```

* `init` tells mixer to create the needed configuration files and 
folders in the workspace
* `--clear-version` tells mixer to start the mix as a mix to this 
upstream Clear Linux OS version
* `--mix-version` tells mixer that our own version will start with `10` 
which is the default
* `--local-rpms` tells mixer to create folders where we can later add 
our own custom RPM files

## builder.conf

```
[Builder]
SERVER_STATE_DIR=/home/clear/mix/update
BUNDLE_DIR=/home/clear/mix/mix-bundles
YUM_CONF=/home/clear/mix/.yum-mix.conf
CERT=/home/clear/mix/Swupd_Root.pem
VERSIONS_PATH=/home/clear/mix

[swupd]
BUNDLE=os-core-update
CONTENTURL=<URL where the content will be hosted>
VERSIONURL=<URL where the version of the mix will be hosted>
FORMAT=1

[Server]
debuginfo_banned=true
debuginfo_lib=/usr/lib/debug/
debuginfo_src=/usr/src/debug/

[Mixer]
LOCAL_BUNDLE_DIR=/home/clear/mix/local-bundles
LOCAL_RPM_DIR=/home/clear/mix/local-rpms
LOCAL_REPO_DIR=/home/clear/mix/local-yum
```

The mixer initialization creates a `builder.conf` file that will store 
the basic configuration options for `mixer`. Most of the options are 
references to the folder structure in the workspace and some basic 
entries that will be needed.

The items of interest in this file for deployment are going to be the 
`CONTENTURL` and `VERSIONURL` entries that will be needed by systems 
that will update against the mix content that we'll be generating. At a 
later stage we'll fill these in.

The `CERT` variable sets the path where mixer stores the certificate 
file. The certificate file is used to sign the content so it can be 
verified. The software update client uses this certificate to verify 
the signature. Mixer automatically generates a certificate, if you do 
not provide a path to an existing one, and signs the manifest file.


## Bundles

```
~/mix $ mixer bundle list
bootloader     (upstream bundle) 
kernel-native  (upstream bundle) 
os-core        (upstream bundle) 
os-core-update (upstream bundle) 
```

The bundles in the mix are specified in the mix bundle list. Mixer 
stores this list as a flat file called mixbundles in the path set by 
the VERSIONS_PATH variable of the builder.conf file. Mixer 
automatically generates the mixbundles list file during initialization. 
Mixer reads and writes the bundle list file when you change the bundles 
of the mix.

`mixer bundle list` shows a list of every bundle in the mix. Bundles 
can include other bundles. Those nested bundles can themselves include 
other bundles. When listing bundles with this command, mixer 
automatically recurses through the includes to show every single bundle 
in the mix.

If you see an unexpected bundle in the list, that bundle is probably 
included in another bundle. Use `mixer bundle list --tree` to get a 
better view of how a bundle ended up in the mix.

Bundles fall into two categories: upstream and local. Upstream bundles 
are those provided by Clear Linux. Local bundles are either modified 
upstream bundles or new local bundles.

Mixer automatically downloads and caches upstream bundle definition 
files. These definition files are stored in the upstream-bundles 
directory in the workspace. Do not modify the files in this directory. 
This directory is simply a mirror for mixer to use.

The mixer tool automatically caches the bundles for the Clear Linux 
version configured in the upstreamversion file. Mixer also cleans up 
old versions once they are no longer needed. You can see the available 
upstream bundles with the following command:

```
~/mix $ mixer bundle list upstream
<snip>
```

Local bundles are bundles that you create, or are edited versions of 
upstream bundles.

Local bundle definition files live in the local-bundles directory. The 
LOCAL_BUNDLE_DIR variable sets the path of this directory in your 
builder.conf configuration file. For this example, the path is 
`/home/clr/mix/local-bundles`. You can see the available local bundles 
with the following command:

```
~/mix $ mixer bundle list local
bootloader     (upstream bundle) 
kernel-native  (upstream bundle) 
os-core        (upstream bundle) 
os-core-update (upstream bundle) 
```

Both the local and upstream bundle list commands accept the --tree flag 
to show a visual representation of the inclusion relationships between 
the bundles in the mix.


## Create the initial Mix content

```
~/mix $ sudo mixer build all
<snip>

```

This command creates all the needed content for the version we have 
selected and produces a functional `version 10` content stream that can 
be used to deploy to targets.

Each time this command is run, the `version` is updated to `+ 10` and a 
new update content set is created. If you execute the function a few 
times, you'll see the following result in the `www` folder structure:

```
~/mix $ ls update/www/
0  10  20  30  version
```


## Updating

If you desire to update the upstream version of your mix and pull in 
upstream changes, you can do this selectively or automatically.

```
~/mix $ mixer versions update --upstream-version 21570
```

Or:

```
~/mix $ mixer versions update --upstream-version latest
```

An important note here is that you can go **back** upstream versions as 
long as you're not crossing a `format version` change. If you want to 
roll back an upstream change or skip a version, this is all supported. 
After doing the `versions update` change, you can simply rebuild the 
content again and you are finished.


```
~/mix $ sudo mixer build all
```

## What else to try

* Edit an upstream bundle and change the package list to include or 
exclude packages
* Validate a modified bundle
* Downgrade your mix to an older upstream version
